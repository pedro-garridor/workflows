# Workflows

Collection of Snakefiles for different purposes

These Snakefiles are renamed with a descriptive filename. However, will be necessary to change it back to *Snakefile* again before running the pipeline.

- **gatkCNV**: UNDER DEVELOPMENT. This pipeline is intended to call CNVs from exome sequencing with GATK.
- **haplotype**: this pipeline performs variant phasing with WhatsHap and HapCUT2.
- **samtoolsVC**: pipeline for exome alignment (BWA-MEM) and variant calling (samtools call).
